<h4>How to reading CPU graph</h4>

Normally it shows the high utilization system_server process.<br>
That's because it is available from other apps in a common feature of the OS.<br>
<br>
Resident app that is running at regular intervals may have indirectly battery draining.
Even if the CPU utilization is low.
<br><br>
During sleep the CPU is slower.
Therefore it looks like CPU utilization has risen, but it is normal.
